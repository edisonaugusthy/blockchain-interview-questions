## 1. What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a **distributed ledger technology** that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked and secured using cryptography.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Blockchain combines cryptographic hashing, peer-to-peer networking, and consensus mechanisms to create an immutable, transparent database. Each block contains transaction data, timestamp, and the hash of the previous block, forming an unbreakable chain. The distributed nature means no single point of failure, while cryptographic security ensures data integrity. This enables trustless transactions without intermediaries, solving the double-spending problem in digital currencies and enabling programmable money through smart contracts.

## 2. What is the difference between Blockchain and traditional databases?

Blockchain is **decentralized and immutable**, while traditional databases are **centralized and mutable** with administrator control.

**Detailed Explanation:**

| Aspect         | Blockchain                | Traditional Database |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Architecture   | Distributed across nodes  | Centralized server   |
| Data Integrity | Cryptographically secured | Admin-controlled     |
| Trust Model    | Trustless                 | Requires trust       |
| Performance    | Slower (consensus)        | Faster (direct CRUD) |
| Consistency    | Eventually consistent     | ACID properties      |
| Scalability    | Limited by consensus      | Highly scalable      |

Traditional databases excel in enterprise applications requiring fast queries and complex relationships. Blockchain is optimal for trustless interactions, immutable audit trails, and decentralized coordination without intermediaries.

## 3. What are the key characteristics of Blockchain?

**Decentralization, immutability, transparency, security, consensus, and programmability** are the core characteristics.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Decentralization:** No single point of control or failure
- **Immutability:** Data cannot be altered once recorded
- **Transparency:** All transactions publicly verifiable
- **Security:** Cryptographic protection at multiple layers
- **Consensus:** Network agreement on validity without central authority
- **Programmability:** Smart contract capabilities for automation

## 4. What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a **self-executing contract with terms directly written into code** that automatically enforces agreements when predetermined conditions are met.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Smart contracts are deterministic programs deployed on blockchain networks that execute automatically when triggered. They contain business logic, state variables, and functions that manipulate data based on predefined rules. Once deployed, they operate autonomously without human intervention, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs. Common applications include decentralized finance (automated loans, trading), supply chain tracking, insurance claims processing, and governance systems.

## 5. What is Solidity?

Solidity is a **statically-typed programming language** designed for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Solidity draws syntax inspiration from JavaScript, C++, and Python while being purpose-built for smart contract development. It features object-oriented programming with inheritance, libraries, and complex data types. The language compiles to EVM bytecode and includes blockchain-specific features like gas optimization, event emission, and cryptographic functions.

## 6. What are the different types of blockchain networks?

**Public, private, consortium, and hybrid** blockchains serve different use cases and access models.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Public blockchains:** Fully open, permissionless networks (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- **Private blockchains:** Restricted access to specific organizations
- **Consortium blockchains:** Semi-decentralized, controlled by a group
- **Hybrid blockchains:** Combine public and private elements

**[⬆ Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)**

## 7. What is consensus mechanism?

A consensus mechanism is a **protocol that enables distributed nodes to agree on the blockchain's state** without requiring central authority.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Consensus mechanisms solve the fundamental problem of achieving agreement in distributed systems where participants may be malicious or unreliable. They ensure all nodes maintain identical ledger copies while preventing double-spending and maintaining network integrity. Different mechanisms balance security, scalability, and decentralization.

## 287. What is risk management in DeFi?

DeFi risk management involves **identifying and mitigating various protocol risks** including smart contract, market, and liquidity risks.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Encompasses position sizing, diversification, insurance protocols, and automated risk controls. Must consider unique DeFi risks like impermanent loss, protocol upgrades, and composability risks across interconnected protocols.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## 288. What is value at risk (VaR)?

VaR estimates **maximum expected loss** over specific time periods with given confidence levels.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Statistical measure expressing potential loss magnitude and probability. For example, 1-day VaR of $100k at 95% confidence means 95% probability of losing less than $100k in one day. Used for risk budgeting and capital allocation.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## 289. What is liquidity risk?

Liquidity risk is **inability to buy or sell assets** without significant price impact due to insufficient market depth.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Particularly relevant in DeFi where liquidity can be withdrawn rapidly. Affects ability to exit positions, rebalance portfolios, and respond to market changes. Managed through diversification and liquidity monitoring.
